I opened Lo Fi Coffee in June of 2011, it is my first shop and located in the heart of Downtown Mesa. We have been working hard for the past years to create an amazing downtown coffee shop for Mesa. The light rail is being expanded in front of the coffee shop, and we are looking forward to the amazing transitions soon to be seen in Mesa.
