#/about/#
This site was created by me on a super boring night in 2002. I wanted to learn more about web design because I figured it could help me at my job working in a 56k Dial-Up Call Center. Eventually everything I learned from building my own site landed me a development job with my company, and I&#39;ve been a pretty avid designer ever since.

**about sam clark**

There really isn't too much to say about myself. I'm a 31 year old owner of two coffee shops and an uncle of 9 nieces and nephews. I live in Phoenix, Arizona and have claimed it as my domicile for over 11 years. I am a combat veteran of the Marine Corps, and a former soldier in the U.S. Army. I also spent some time doing wildland firefighting. I opened my first coffee shop in the summer of 2011, and opened my second in January of 2012. Sometimes I like to grow a rad beard(beard season is officially October 1st to April 1st). You can find more about my businesses here.


**what to expect**

There really isn&#39;t too much to expect from this site going forward. My main goal is to re-learn modern web design here. I will probably post some tutorials explaining my experiences learning modern web design. I come from a background of php, perl, and old old old html ideals. I am still very grounded in them actually, and it&#39;s proving to be quite challenging to accept that that era is over.
