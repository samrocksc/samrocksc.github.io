I opened Lo Fi Coffee in June of 2011, it is my first shop and located in the heart of Downtown Mesa. We have been working hard for the past years to create an amazing downtown coffee shop for Mesa. The light rail is being expanded in front of the coffee shop, and we are looking forward to the amazing transitions soon to be seen in Mesa.

 In December of 2012 I also opened up Mud Dauber Coffee on 16th Street in Phoenix Arizona in a collaborative project with The Hive.  We were in place at this location for a year and a half, and sold the business to some new business owners in May of 2014.

 I am currently working with The Trunk Space on Grand Avenue to implement Lo Fi Coffee as an additional amenity to the venue as is.
