Welcome to shoutinginfrench. This is the personal website for Sam Clark, and was created in 2002 on a whim to learn how to do web design better at my day job for corporate America. Ever since then it has gone through several re-designs, and different types of content management. It has been used for several reasons to keep family updated while I was in the military, or as a test database for websites that I was building.

This site is part blog, hobbyist coding, and information site about what I do and how I operate as a coffee shop owner.

I recently stopped providing a blog roll from tumblr, you can read more about why I chose to do so [here](/public/rants/death-to-blogs). I hope you enjoy some of the ramblings and writings on the site. I update it semi-frequently.
