			<h1>Quitting The Blog</h1>
<p>I am writing this now because I am removing my blogs from the internet.  It is something I realized today as I sit here today.  I am realizing that really the whole idea of blogging for your website may in fact finally have died finally.  There are so many blogging systems coming out.  </p>
<p>Microblogging in the form of <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, aggregated blogging in the form of <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">tumblr</a>, and the soon to be &quot;medium blogging&quot; in the form of <a href="http://www.medium.com">medium</a> are all showing signs of the dying trend of placing blogs on our website.  For approximately three years now, I have been leaving a copy of my blog from tumblr on my website.  This allowed to people what I was thinking and even some mini-writes.  It&#39;s rare though that I actually find the motivation to write about my life.</p>
<p>A majority of my blogging has came in the form of tweets and facebook updates over the past five years.  It&#39;s time that we combine our ability to communicate into mediums that will combine society.</p>
<p>With that, today I&#39;m going to pick my most favorite rants and writings from my tumblr feed, and recreate them as permanent files.  I think going forward this is the wave of the future.</p>
<p>The idea of wordpress as a standalone website is slowly winding down.  Slowly it has been compressed into a huge bloated conglomerate of files that waste huge amounts of web resources for menial tasks.</p>
<p>It&#39;s time to start looking with responsibility with the content we produce on the web, and recognizing where it should be shared.  Is our posting newsworthy?  Is it blogworthy?  Should it be syndicated, or should it be put into the aggregated pool?  Will the information we write today be pertinent in the future?  These are all things we should consider when we write and how we place it.</p>
<p>Recently I had a programmer friend send me a video of a talk by a developer about the creation of his open source projects.  He spoke of how when he wrote in the open source and he didn&#39;t maintain it, it would become bloated.  I think the same thought process can be applied to blogging.  Perhaps its time to let go, and let our blogs roll with the tides of time, and start producing content that can stand the waves of time.  </p>
<p>Keeping our articles updated may be just as important as the frequency at which we produce them. There can be no confusion that the web is becoming clogged and bloated with archaic writings that did not stand the tests of time.  I think we should remember that there is a reason blog rolls &quot;roll&quot;. </p>
