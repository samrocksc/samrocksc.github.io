I wanted to learn more about web design because I figured it could help me at my job working in a 56k Dial-Up Call Center.  Eventually everything I learned from building my own site landed me a development job with my company, and I've been a pretty avid designer ever since.\n        </p>\n        <h2>about sam clark</h2>\n        <p>\n            There really isn't too much to say about myself.  I'm a 31 year old owner of two coffee shops and an uncle of 9 nieces and nephews.  I live in Phoenix, Arizona and have claimed it as my domicile for over 11 years.  I am a combat veteran of the Marine Corps, and a former soldier in the U.S. Army.  I also spent some time doing wildland firefighting.  I opened my first coffee shop in the summer of 2011, and opened my second in January of 2012.  Sometimes I like to grow a rad beard(beard season is officially October 1st to April 1st).  You can find more about my businesses <a href=\"businesses.html\">here</a>.\n        </p>\n        <h2>what to expect</h2>\n        <p>\n            There really isn't too much to expect from this site going forward.  My main goal is to re-learn modern web design here.  I will probably post some tutorials explaining my experiences learning modern web design.  I come from a background of php, perl, and old old old html ideals.  I am still very grounded in them actually, and it's proving to be quite challenging to accept that that era is over.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"footer\"><a href='{{index}}'>{{copyright}}</a> || Sam Clark || <a href='mailto:{{email}}?Subject=shoutinginfrench.com'>{{showemail}}</a>\n        <br/><br/>{{#social}}<a href='{{link}}' target='_blank'><img src='images/{{img}}' class='fade'/></a>{{/social}}\n</div>    \n</script>\n    <script src=\"scripts/template.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2801}]],"length":2801}
