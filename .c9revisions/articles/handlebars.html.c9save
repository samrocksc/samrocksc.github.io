I learned how to template originally using PHP includes; however, I found that this was not a very optimal form of templating my sites.  Blaine from <a href=\"http://www.iceddev.com\">Iced Dev</a> recommended I learn how to template using a javascript library called <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">handlebars.js</a>.  \n            </p>\n            <h2>Understanding the structure</h2>\n            <p>\n                The hardest part of learning code now is that I don't understand a lot about the structure for how a lot of people build their apps etc.  I do, but I don't, so figuring this out was the trickiest part of the whole thing.  For this example I'm going to use three different files: index.html, template.js, and page.css.
