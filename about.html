        <h2>/about/</h2>
        <p>
            This site was created by me on a super boring night in 2002.  I wanted to learn more about web design because I figured it could help me at my job working in a 56k Dial-Up Call Center.  Eventually everything I learned from building my own site landed me a development job with my company, and I've been a pretty avid designer ever since.

        <h2>about sam clark</h2>
        <p>
            There really isn't too much to say about myself.  I'm a 31 year old owner of two coffee shops and an uncle of 9 nieces and nephews.  I live in Phoenix, Arizona and have claimed it as my domicile for over 11 years.  I am a combat veteran of the Marine Corps, and a former soldier in the U.S. Army.  I also spent some time doing wildland firefighting.  I opened my first coffee shop in the summer of 2011, and opened my second in January of 2012.  Sometimes I like to grow a rad beard(beard season is officially October 1st to April 1st).  You can find more about my businesses <a href="businesses.html">here</a>.

        <h2>what to expect</h2>
        <p>
            There really isn't too much to expect from this site going forward.  My main goal is to re-learn modern web design here.  I will probably post some tutorials explaining my experiences learning modern web design.  I come from a background of php, perl, and old old old html ideals.  I am still very grounded in them actually, and it's proving to be quite challenging to accept that that era is over.
